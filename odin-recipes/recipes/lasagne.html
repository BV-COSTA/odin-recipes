<h2>Steps</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
Gather all your ingredients.
<h3>Step 2</h3>
Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
<h3>Step 3</h3>
Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
<h3>Step 4</h3>
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
<h3>Step 5</h3>
In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
<h3>Step 6</h3>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
<h3>Step 7</h3>
To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
<h3>Step 8</h3>
Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
<h3>Step 9</h3>
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
<h3>Step 10</h3>
Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
